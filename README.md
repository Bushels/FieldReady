# FieldReady 🌾

**Precision Agriculture Platform for Canadian Prairie Farmers**

FieldReady is a comprehensive Flutter web application that provides intelligent harvest timing recommendations by combining combine equipment capabilities with real-time weather data and crop-specific thresholds.

## 🎯 Overview

Built using a specialized AI agent architecture, FieldReady helps farmers optimize harvest timing by:

- **Intelligent Combine Selection**: Fuzzy search across 12+ combine models with detailed specifications
- **Weather Integration**: Tomorrow.io API with MSC fallback and intelligent caching (70-85% cost reduction)
- **Crop-Specific Analysis**: Threshold analysis for wheat, canola, barley, and oats with economic impact calculations
- **Equipment Factor Analysis**: Real-time capability adjustments based on weather conditions
- **Field-Ready UX**: Large touch targets, high contrast design optimized for outdoor use

## 🚀 Current Features

### ✅ Implemented
- **Combine Selection UI**: Full-screen modal with command-palette search
- **Firebase Integration**: Real-time data from Firestore with PIPEDA-compliant security
- **Fuzzy Search**: Intelligent matching across brands, models, and capabilities
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts from mobile to desktop (1-4 column layouts)
- **Progressive Web App**: Installable with offline capabilities
- **Professional UX**: Smooth animations, hover effects, and micro-interactions

### 🔄 In Development
- Real-time weather integration
- Harvest timing recommendations
- Equipment factor calculations
- Advanced analytics dashboard

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Tech Stack (Committed)
- **Frontend**: Flutter 3.32.8 (Web + Future Mobile)
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Functions, Storage)
- **State Management**: BLoC pattern with Hydrated persistence
- **Database**: Firestore with comprehensive indexes
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting
- **Philosophy**: Vibecoder-friendly with CLI simplicity

> **🎯 Strategic Decision**: This project is committed to Flutter/Firebase for maximum developer velocity, offline-first capabilities, and single-codebase mobile expansion. Perfect for vibecoding workflow with `flutter run` + `firebase deploy` simplicity.

## 🤖 Agent Architecture

This project was built using specialized AI agents, each with specific expertise:

| Agent | Role | Key Contributions |
|-------|------|------------------|
| **master-orchestrator** | Project coordination & validation | System integration, execution planning |
| **documentation-orchestrator** | Technical documentation | PROJECT_STATE.md, decision logging |
| **backend-architect** | Data architecture & APIs | Firebase setup, repository patterns |
| **weather-intelligence** | Weather data & caching | Tomorrow.io integration, cost optimization |
| **state-manager** | Application state management | BLoC patterns, equipment factors |
| **frontend-ux** | User interface & experience | Combine selection UI, field-ready design |
| **error-fixing** | Code quality & debugging | Compilation fixes, dependency management |

See [AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed agent documentation.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Flutter 3.24+ installed
- Firebase CLI (for deployment)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bushels/FieldReady.git
   cd FieldReady
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   flutter run -d chrome --web-port 8080
   ```

4. **Or build for production**
   ```bash
   flutter build web
   ```

### Firebase Setup (Optional)
The app includes hardcoded demo data but can connect to Firebase for real data:

1. Create a Firebase project
2. Enable Firestore, Auth, and Storage
3. Update Firebase configuration in `lib/main.dart`
4. Deploy security rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`

## 📱 Usage

### Combine Selection
1. Click the **"Add Your Combine"** button or floating action button
2. Use the **command palette search** to find your combine:
   - Type brand names: "John", "Case", "Claas"
   - Search by model: "S780", "8250", "CR10.90"
   - Find by capability: "tough straw", "high moisture"
3. **Filter by brand** using the filter chips
4. **Select your combine** from the responsive grid

### Dashboard Features
- **Combine specifications** with key stats (header size, engine power, capacity)
- **Capability indicators** showing equipment strengths
- **Rating display** with community feedback
- **Mock harvest intelligence** (full integration coming soon)

## 🎨 UX Design Principles

FieldReady follows **field-ready design principles**:

### Clarity Over Clutter
- Information at-a-glance for farmers in moving vehicles
- Strong visual hierarchy with ample white space
- Essential data prominently displayed

### Data as Actionable Insight  
- Technical specs translated to farmer benefits
- "Best For" capabilities instead of raw numbers
- Economic impact calculations for decision support

### Delight in the Details
- Subtle animations and smooth transitions
- Hover effects and micro-interactions
- Professional polish without distraction

### Built for the Field
- **Large touch targets** (44px minimum)
- **High contrast** colors for sunlight readability
- **Intuitive gestures** for tablet/phone use in vehicles
- **Responsive design** for all screen sizes

## 📊 Technical Specifications
