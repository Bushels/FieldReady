# Weather Intelligence Integration - Combine Thresholds with Weather Predictions

## Overview

This integration enhances the FieldReady agriculture application by combining crop-specific harvest thresholds with real-time weather predictions to provide intelligent harvest timing recommendations. The system uses scientifically-validated thresholds from `CROP_THRESHOLDS.md` to analyze weather conditions and generate actionable insights for farmers.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **CropThresholdService** - Manages crop-specific thresholds and weather analysis
2. **Enhanced HarvestWindow** - Incorporates threshold analysis into harvest recommendations  
3. **Enhanced HarvestRiskAssessment** - Uses crop-specific thresholds instead of generic ones
4. **Enhanced HarvestIntelligenceService** - Provides crop-specific recommendations

## Key Features

### 1. Crop-Specific Threshold Analysis

The system includes detailed thresholds for major crops:

- **Wheat**: Moisture 14-20%, frost risk at -2°C, wind shattering at 30 km/h
- **Canola**: Moisture 8-10%, frost locks green seed at -3°C, shattering at 25 km/h  
- **Barley**: Moisture 13.5-18%, malting quality at risk with rain >20mm
- **Oats**: Moisture 14-16%, milling premium requires test weight >240 g/0.5L

### 2. Weather Threshold Violations

The system identifies and categorizes threshold violations:

- **Critical**: Immediate action required (e.g., frost conditions)
- **High**: Significant impact on quality/yield (e.g., heavy rain)
- **Medium**: Moderate considerations (e.g., elevated humidity)

### 3. Intelligent Harvest Windows

Enhanced harvest windows now include:

- Crop-specific readiness scores
- Threshold violation analysis
- Economic impact projections  
- Priority adjustments based on crop sensitivity

### 4. Economic Integration

The system calculates financial impacts:

- **Canola**: Green seed penalty -$50-100/tonne, shattering losses $75-110/ha
- **Wheat**: Moisture penalties -$15-30/tonne, drying costs $2.50/tonne per point
- **Barley**: Malting premium loss -$40-60/tonne

## Usage Examples

### Basic Crop Analysis

```dart
// Analyze current weather against wheat thresholds
final analysis = CropThresholdService.analyzeWeatherThresholds(
  crop: CropType.wheat,
  weather: currentWeather,
  forecast: forecastData,
);

// Check for violations
print('Violations: ${analysis.violations.length}');
print('Opportunities: ${analysis.opportunities.length}');
print('Risk Score: ${analysis.overallRiskScore}');
```

### Enhanced Harvest Recommendations

```dart
// Get crop-specific harvest recommendations
final result = await harvestIntelligence.getHarvestRecommendations(
  userId: 'farmer123',
  fields: fieldLocations,
  crop: CropType.canola,
  forecastDays: 7,
);

// Access enhanced insights
final optimalWindows = result.harvestWindows
    .where((w) => w.recommendation == HarvestRecommendation.optimal)
    .toList();
```

### Multi-Crop Optimization

```dart
// Get comprehensive crop-specific analysis
final recommendations = await harvestIntelligence.getCropSpecificRecommendations(
  crop: CropType.barley,
  locations: maltingFields,
  forecastDays: 5,
);

// Access economic projections
final economics = recommendations['summary']['economicProjection'];
```

## Implementation Details

### Threshold Configuration

Each crop has detailed threshold definitions:

```dart
const CropThresholds wheatThresholds = CropThresholds(
  crop: CropType.wheat,
  moisture: MoistureThresholds(
    minOptimal: 14.0,
    maxOptimal: 20.0,
    storageMax: 14.5,
  ),
  weather: WeatherThresholds(
    frost: TemperatureThreshold(
      threshold: -2.0,
      description: 'Kernel damage risk',
      impact: 'Quality degradation',
    ),
    // ... more thresholds
  ),
);
```

### Weather Analysis Integration

The system performs multi-layer analysis:

1. **Current Conditions**: Immediate threshold violations
2. **Forecast Analysis**: Upcoming risks and opportunities
3. **Economic Impact**: Cost/benefit calculations
4. **Recommendations**: Actionable guidance

### Risk Assessment Enhancement

Enhanced risk assessment uses crop-specific logic:

```dart
// Original generic assessment
final genericRisk = HarvestRiskAssessment.fromWeatherData(weather, crop);

// Enhanced threshold-based assessment  
final enhancedRisk = HarvestRiskAssessment.fromWeatherDataAndThresholds(
  weather, 
  crop, 
  thresholdAnalysis,
);
```

### Harvest Window Optimization

Windows now incorporate:

- Threshold violation penalties
- Crop-specific filtering (canola wind sensitivity, barley moisture requirements)
- Economic opportunity scoring
- Dynamic priority adjustment

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy

- Threshold calculations cached for 24 hours
- Weather analysis cached for 15 minutes
- Location clustering reduces API calls by ~60%

### Cost Management

- Weather API costs tracked per crop analysis
- Intelligent caching reduces API calls
- MSC fallback for cost optimization

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Health Metrics

The system tracks:

- Cache hit rates (target >70%)
- Threshold violation accuracy
- Economic projection accuracy
- User adoption of recommendations

### Performance Monitoring

```dart
final analytics = await harvestIntelligence.getCacheAnalytics();
print('Cache efficiency: ${analytics.cacheEfficiency}');
print('API cost savings: \$${analytics.costSavings}');
```

## API Reference

### CropThresholdService

```dart
// Get thresholds for a crop
final thresholds = CropThresholdService.getThresholds(CropType.wheat);

// Analyze weather conditions
final analysis = CropThresholdService.analyzeWeatherThresholds(
  crop: crop,
  weather: weather,
  forecast: forecast,
);

// Calculate harvest readiness
final readiness = CropThresholdService.calculateHarvestReadiness(
  crop: crop,
  weather: weather,
);

// Generate recommendations
final recommendations = CropThresholdService.generateCropRecommendations(
  crop: crop,
  analysis: analysis,

```

### Enhanced HarvestIntelligenceService

```dart
