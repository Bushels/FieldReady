# Firebase Backend Architecture - FieldFirst Combine Intelligence System

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive Firebase backend architecture for the FieldFirst combine specifications and normalization system. The architecture implements an offline-first design with robust sync mechanisms, privacy compliance (PIPEDA), and progressive data insights.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Firestore Collections Design

#### Core Collections

**`combineSpecs`** - Master combine specifications
- `brand`: Normalized brand name (john_deere, case_ih, etc.)
- `model`: Normalized model name (x9_1100, s790, etc.)
- `modelVariants`: Array of alternative spellings
- `moistureTolerance`: Min/max/optimal moisture percentages
- `toughCropAbility`: Rating and supported crops
- `sourceData`: User reports, manufacturer specs, expert validation
- `isPublic`: Whether to include in aggregations
- `region`: Geographic region for relevance

**`userCombines`** - User's personal equipment
- `userId`: Owner reference
- `combineSpecId`: Reference to CombineSpec
- `nickname`: User's name for their combine
- `customSettings`: Moisture preferences, crop experience
- `isActive`: Currently in use flag
- `lastSyncAt`: Offline sync timestamp

**`modelNormalization`** - Fuzzy matching rules
- `pattern`: Pattern to match against
- `canonical`: Standardized result
- `confidence`: Rule confidence score
- `usageCount`: Frequency of use
- `source`: manual/learned/fuzzy

**`combineInsights`** - Aggregated community data
- `region`: Geographic area
- `level`: basic/brand/model (progressive detail)
- `totalFarmers`: Number of users
- `insights`: Nested data by detail level
- `expiresAt`: Cache expiration

#### Supporting Collections

**`brandAliases`** - Brand name mappings
**`modelVariants`** - Model spelling variations
**`normalizationLearning`** - User correction feedback
**`regionalInsights`** - Geographic aggregations
**`auditLogs`** - PIPEDA compliance tracking

### 2. Security Rules

The Firestore security rules implement:

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users can only access their own data
- **Data Validation**: All documents validated on write
- **Aggregation Privacy**: Public insights readable by authenticated users
- **Admin Controls**: Normalization rules require admin access
- **Audit Compliance**: All data access logged appropriately

Key rule patterns:
```javascript
// Combine specs are public, but only admins can write.
match /combineSpecs/{specId} {
  allow read: if true;
  allow write: if request.auth.token.admin == true;
}

// Users can only read and write their own combines.
match /userCombines/{userId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```

### 3. Cloud Functions

#### Normalization Function
- **Purpose**: Fuzzy match user input to canonical combine models
- **Features**: Levenshtein distance, brand aliases, confidence scoring
- **Response**: Top 3 matches with confidence levels

#### Confirmation Function
- **Purpose**: Learn from user corrections
- **Features**: Update normalization rules, improve matching accuracy
- **Compliance**: Log all learning for transparency

#### Insights Generation
- **Purpose**: Create progressive community insights
- **Levels**: 
  - Basic (< 5 users): General harvest statistics
  - Brand (5-15 users): Brand-specific performance
  - Model (15+ users): Detailed model capabilities

#### Real-time Aggregation
- **Trigger**: Firestore document changes
- **Purpose**: Update regional/brand/model statistics
- **Performance**: Batched updates with exponential backoff

### 4. Offline-First Architecture

#### Repository Pattern
Clean separation between data sources and business logic:
```dart
abstract class CombineRepository {
  Future<CombineSpec?> getById(String id);
  Future<List<CombineSpec>> getByBrand(String brand);
  Future<void> syncWithRemote();
}
```

#### Sync Queue Implementation
- **Operation Types**: Create, Update, Delete
- **Priority Levels**: High, Medium, Low
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff (max 5 retries)
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins with intelligent merging

#### Offline Cache
- **Storage**: Local SQLite with encrypted sensitive data
- **Expiration**: TTL-based with manual refresh capability
- **Size Management**: LRU eviction with configurable limits
- **Sync Status**: Real-time connectivity monitoring

### 5. Combine Normalizer Service

#### Fuzzy Matching Algorithm
```dart
class CombineNormalizer {
  // 1. Exact match check
  // 2. Known variant lookup
  // 3. Brand alias matching
  // 4. Levenshtein distance fuzzy matching
  
  Future<List<FuzzyMatchResult>> normalize(String input) {
    // Returns top 3 matches with confidence scores
  }
}
```

#### Confidence Scoring
Multi-factor confidence calculation:
- Edit distance (40% weight)
- Length similarity (20% weight)
- Brand match (20% weight)
- Year validation (10% weight)
- Context clues (10% weight)

#### Learning System
- User corrections stored in `normalizationLearning`
- Pattern analysis for rule improvement
- Confidence threshold adjustment
- Performance monitoring and reporting

### 6. Privacy & Compliance (PIPEDA)

#### Data Minimization
- Only collect necessary combine specifications
- User consent for data sharing and research
- Automatic anonymization for aggregations

#### Audit Trail
- All data access logged with user, action, timestamp
- IP address and user agent tracking
- Change history with before/after values
- Compliance level categorization

#### Data Retention
- Configurable retention policies per collection
- Automatic cleanup of expired data
- User right to deletion (account termination)
- Export capability for data portability

#### User Rights
- Data access: Export all user data
- Data correction: Update incorrect information  
- Data deletion: Remove all personal data
- Consent withdrawal: Opt out of data sharing

### 7. Performance Optimization

#### Indexing Strategy
```javascript
// Compound indexes for common query patterns
combineSpecs: ['brand', 'model', 'region']
userCombines: ['userId', 'isActive', 'updatedAt']
insights: ['region', 'level', 'expiresAt']
```

#### Caching Layers
- **Client Cache**: 24-hour TTL for normalize results
- **Function Cache**: 5-minute TTL for insights
- **CDN Cache**: 1-hour TTL for public data

#### Connection Pooling
- Firebase Admin SDK connection reuse
- Batch operations where possible
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### 8. Error Handling & Resilience

#### Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Automatic fallback to cached data
- Graceful degradation of features
- Service health monitoring

#### Retry Mechanisms
- Exponential backoff for failed operations
- Jittered delays to prevent thundering herd
- Maximum retry limits to prevent infinite loops

#### Monitoring & Alerting
- Function execution metrics
- Error rate tracking
- Performance threshold alerts
- User engagement analytics
