# FieldFirst Project Initialization - Execution Plan

## Project Overview
FieldFirst is a precision agriculture platform providing hyperlocal weather intelligence for Canadian prairie farmers to optimize harvest timing and minimize crop loss.

## Current State Analysis
The project currently has:
- Firebase configuration with Firestore, Functions, and Hosting
- Flutter/Dart frontend with Firebase integration
- Basic combine management system
- Documentation for various components

## Target Architecture
Based on PROJECT_STATE.md, we need to migrate/expand to:
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS extensions
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Weather Data**: Tomorrow.io API (primary), MSC as fallback
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend), Railway/Render (backend)

## Execution Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup (Week 1)

#### 1.1 Environment Configuration
- [ ] Create `.env.local` for frontend configuration
- [ ] Create `.env` for backend configuration
- [ ] Set up environment variables as specified in PROJECT_STATE.md
- [ ] Configure Git workflows and branch protection

#### 1.2 Next.js Frontend Setup
```bash
# Initialize Next.js 14 with TypeScript
npx create-next-app@14 frontend --typescript --tailwind --app --src-dir
```

Directory structure:
```

├── public/                  # Static assets
└── tests/                   # Test files
```

#### 1.3 Backend API Setup
```bash
# Initialize Node.js backend
mkdir backend && cd backend
npm init -y
npm install express typescript @types/express @types/node
npm install -D nodemon ts-node eslint prettier
```

Directory structure:
```

└── scripts/
```

#### 1.4 Database Setup
- [ ] Install PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension
- [ ] Create database schema for:
  - Users and authentication
  - Fields with geospatial data
  - Weather data caching
  - Combine specifications
  - Community observations
  - Alert configurations

#### 1.5 Redis Configuration
- [ ] Install and configure Redis for caching
- [ ] Set up connection pooling
- [ ] Implement cache invalidation strategies

### Phase 2: Core Services Implementation (Week 2-3)

#### 2.1 Weather Intelligence Engine
Create `/backend/src/services/weather/`:
- `TomorrowIOClient.ts` - Tomorrow.io API integration
- `MSCFallbackClient.ts` - Government weather data fallback
- `WeatherAggregator.ts` - Data normalization and caching
- `LocationClusterer.ts` - Hexagonal grid clustering (5km radius)

Key features:
- 6-hour cache for forecast data
- 24-hour cache for historical data
- Automatic fallback to MSC on API failures
- Location clustering to reduce API calls

#### 2.2 Field Management System
Create `/backend/src/services/fields/`:
- `FieldRepository.ts` - CRUD operations with PostGIS
- `FieldBoundaryService.ts` - Polygon management
- `HarvestWindowCalculator.ts` - Core optimization algorithms

Key features:
- GeoJSON polygon storage
- Spatial queries for weather correlation
- Multi-field management
- Historical harvest data tracking

#### 2.3 Combine Intelligence System
Migrate and enhance existing combine system:
- Model normalization with fuzzy matching
- Progressive data aggregation (Level 1-3)
- Moisture tolerance tracking
- Tough crop capability analysis

### Phase 3: User-Facing Features (Week 4-5)

#### 3.1 Frontend Pages
Create Next.js pages:
- `/` - Landing page with weather dashboard
- `/fields` - Field management interface
- `/harvest` - Harvest window optimization
- `/combines` - Equipment management
- `/community` - Local observations
- `/alerts` - Alert configuration

#### 3.2 Alert System
Implement multi-channel alerts:
- Real-time weather monitoring
- Email notifications (SendGrid)
- SMS alerts for premium users (Twilio)
- In-app notifications
- Custom alert rules

#### 3.3 Community Features
- User observation submission
- Data validation and quality control
- Community insights aggregation
- Local knowledge sharing

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing (Week 6)

- Rollback procedures
- Data backup strategies
- User feedback loops

## Development Workflow

### Git Strategy
- `main` - Production branch
- `develop` - Integration branch
- Feature branches: `feature/weather-engine`
- Hotfix branches: `hotfix/api-rate-limit`

### Code Review Process
